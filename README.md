# URL Shortener Microservices

A high-performance URL shortener system built with Spring Boot, designed with a distributed microservices architecture.
This project features separate services for read and write operations, database replication for scalability and
reliability, and Redis for caching frequently accessed URLs.

## Features ‚ú®

1. **Scalable Microservices Architecture**: Two distinct services to handle write and read operations independently.
    - **write-service**: Handles the creation of new shortened URLs.
    - **read-service**: Manages the redirection from short URLs to the original URLs.
1. **Database Replication**: A master-slave database setup ensures high availability and load distribution.
    - The write-service connects to the master database.
    - The read-service connects to the slave (replica) database.
1. **Caching with Redis**: Frequently accessed URLs are cached in Redis to provide near-instantaneous redirection and
   reduce database load.
1. **Containerized**: The entire application is containerized using Docker for easy setup and deployment.

## Architecture Overview üèõÔ∏è

The system is designed to be highly scalable and resilient by separating the write and read concerns.

1. **Write Operations**: When a user wants to shorten a URL, the request is sent to the write-service. This service
   generates a unique short code, saves the mapping to the master database, and returns the shortened URL to the user.
1. **Read Operations**: When a user accesses a shortened URL, the request hits the read-service.
    - The service first checks Redis for the original URL.
    - If the URL is not in the cache, it queries the slave database.
    - Once retrieved, the original URL is cached in Redis for future requests, and the user is redirected.
